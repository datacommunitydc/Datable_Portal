* Worked with statisticians to create an algorithm that identified wireless customers with a defective handset.  This was done by doing a Regression analysis of engineering calling records on good and bad devices and identifying characteristics of device specific issues versus network issues.  

* For a Marketing division of a wireless carrier, helped create a tool that identified behaviors and preferences of their customers based on location, phone and plan.  Again, worked with the customer, software architects and developers to interpret DPI, deep packet inspection or probe, data, to distinguish HTTP, streaming, sms, etc and where possible, categorized each data set using a customized dictionary.  

* Using crowd sourced wireless device data in Google Bigquery and SQL, created network level insights on quality of service, i.e. throughput, latency, data usage, on cellular and wifi.  Since Network Operators have a limited view of either cellular or wifi, being able to see location specific comparison of wifi and cellular was a unique insight.  For a wifi provider, forecasted when 5 GHz spectrum will become fully congested.

Real time data collection from manufacturing equipment sensors and logs. Integrated analytics with time series, variability analysis, prescriptive analytics with auto commonality, statistical process control, etc. Built interactive descriptive analytic tools with various javascript libraries in canvas and D3 with backend analytics done in R and Python. 
2.	Implemented predictive analytics of manufacturing products using image processing and machine learning (using packages like e1071 in R and Spark MLlib, etc.). Image processing is done using OpenCV.
3.	Designed and implemented manufacturing flow and path analysis using graph analytical tools (Neo4j) for best yielding path, etc.

Big Data Academia Project: Queried the dataset in Hadoop and AWS using Pig to derive insights into particular demographics’ cause of death.
Implemented models like Naïve Bayes, classification trees using PySpark in AWS, connected via an SSH tunnel to predict whether a person prefers to be buried or cremated. 
Data Mining Academia Project: Implemented data mining algorithms such as neural networks on wine data in R Studio to provide insights about the salient physicochemical characteristics in prediction of quality of wine. Achieved a prediction accuracy of 82% using random forest.
